This was a team project made with my fellow students and friends Mpouzas Ioannis and Xydas Nikolaos! The project was assigned by Dr Panos Vassiliadis, professor
of the Software Development course (Third semester CSE University of Ioannina)!

The basic structure of the project was given by the teacher, and we had to implement the business logic and the backend filtering classes. We also had to present a 
report analizing the use cases, the build process/develonent, test cases and UML diagrams of the hole project's structure.

This was one of the most interesting semester assignments i've made in which i learned the basics about the built/testing process of an end-user software product and the
problems that may be encountered during the development!

Note: Project made with JAVA using Eclipse IDE
